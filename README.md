# Awards_Hub
Developed a web service during a group project for the Databases and Web Services course. It is an award finder with many different types of filters. The user can search for Grammy awards based on years, genres, artist and more. The website is also linked to a database and provides user interface to be able to insert into the back-end through the website.

In this project, I was mainly responsible for handling the connection with the database, using mainly PHP and MySQL, and some HTML/JS.

The website can also be found at: http://clabsql.clamv.jacobs-university.de/~mborsos/ Note: this an only can be accessed through VPN or at Jacobs University Bremen.
